        <p>Welcome to my corner of the web. This website lives mainly as a sandbox for me to fiddle with different web technologies. I also try my best to blog about things I'm interested in, such as software development, data science, machine learning, privacy, etc.</p>

        <p>I'm not too active on social media, but I try to keep my <Link href='/now'>now</Link> page updated everytime I do something worth mentioning.</p>

        <h2>This website</h2>
