# Personal website powered by Next.js and Markdown

Personal "plain text" website with a markdown blog. I use this website as a sandbox for me to fiddle with different web technologies that interest me. Before this version it was built with Gatsby.js and before that it had a headless Wordpress blog. Next version might be built with Python, who knows :man_shrugging:
