# Personal website powered by Next.js and Markdown

Personal "plain text" website with a markdown blog.

### Reasoning

This used to be a modern and complex website with a headless Wordpress blog and animations everywhere and A LOT of CSS. But I got tired of it. This site is continuously getting more and more minimalistic and I like it. I like to browse minimalistic internet and this is my contribution to it.
